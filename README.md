# Star Wars Characters

## Project Description:

I created a SPA (Single Page Application) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It shows all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people). 

### Process 

1. Display an image for each of the characters.

2. Make a HTTP request to the star wars API and use the result from the request to populate the frontend application

- Display a list with the names of each person from the API request.
- On Clicking any name, display the details of that user on the screen, with name, gender, height only

3. All implementations was done using es6.

4. Page is responsive.
